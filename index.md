### OR, AND gates 

The breadboard contains an OR gate and AND gate.

Inputs are controlled with pushbuttons.

The outputs are connected to LEDs to easily observe their states. Gates act independently.

- Power: 5V
- 7408 QUADRUPLE 2-INPUT POSITIVE-AND 
- 7486 Quad EXCLUSIVE-OR Gate
- Red LED: 330Ω
- Red LED: 220Ω (probably)
